DEBUGGING MP3 
===============

The only steps that need to be taken on the virtual machine for debugging
using qemu is to perform a "sudo make debug" (after "make dep").  This will build the disk image needed for QEMU and gdb.  

Refer to the handout for instructions on starting QEMU and gdb.

#list of major bugs, bugs for days

checkpoint 1
---------------------------------------------
Problem: keyboard was not getting character properly
Solution: Scan code table offsets were not properly made
--Alan

Problem: keyboard was not recieving characters properly
Solution: Needed a CLI STI around critical keyboard section to not get interrupted
--Alan

Problem: IDT was not calling interrupts when expected
Solution: Fixed assembly linkage 
--Jai
Problem: Keyboard spammed characters 
Solution: syncronization cli, sti

Solution: added a statement to set i equal to zero initially
--Gerald
Problem: Halt was not returning to proper return values

--Gerald
Problem: Sometimes while spamming the keyboard our hello prompt won't get the correct name
Solution: Work in progress
--Gerald 

checkpoint 5
---------------------------------------------
Problem: the PIT was not properly giving interupts
Solution: active low not set when trying to add the PIT, needed to make a new mask in the PIC
--Alan

Fixed issue with halt with scheduling, was not correctly updating 
the previous process number so that each terminal stores the correct 
process on the screen
--Gerald

Problem: Text was being overidden when switching terminals 
Solution: modified putc to account for new terminals
